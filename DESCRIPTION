Description: Implementation of the Balke-Pearl bounds for the average causal effect under 
  an instrumental variable model. The package can cope with a binary outcome and 
  treatment/phenotype and an instrument with either 2 or 3 categories. The package implements 
  bounds for situations where these 3 variables are measured in the same dataset (trivariate data) 
  or where the outcome and instrument are measured in one study and the treatment/phenotype and 
  instrument are measured in another study.
