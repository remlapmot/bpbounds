# bpbounds: Nonparametric Bounds for the Average Causal Effect Due to Balke and Pearl and Extensions

Implementation of the nonparametric bounds for the average causal effect
under an instrumental variable model by Balke and Pearl (Bounds on
Treatment Effects from Studies with Imperfect Compliance, JASA, 1997,
92, 439, 1171-1176,
[doi:10.2307/2965583](https://doi.org/10.2307/2965583) ). The package
can calculate bounds for a binary outcome, a binary treatment/phenotype,
and an instrument with either 2 or 3 categories. The package implements
bounds for situations where these 3 variables are measured in the same
dataset (trivariate data) or where the outcome and instrument are
measured in one study and the treatment/phenotype and instrument are
measured in another study (bivariate data).
